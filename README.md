# MyMap
An iOS app that helps a user manage where they've been and where they're going.

## Goal
MyMap aims to give the user personal and easy control over their location. Users can generate, view, and edit paths or "maps" that they've traversed. This includes obtaining coordinates for points along a path for everything from short hikes, long bike outings, car rides, or even plane flights! Current personal GPS solutions are internet enabled or expensive. MyMap is neither! It is a standalone open source application that cannot stalk or track the user.

## Features
Creating and viewing personal maps and trails
Getting GPS coordinates of real world locations
Managing personal points of interests and take notes about locations or paths
Total privacy and transparency
Works in the background with no hit to battery life
